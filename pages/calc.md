For ``U \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n``, a function ``f: U \to \mathbb{R}^m`` is said to be **``C^k``** or **``k``-times continuously differentiable** if each component function has partial derivatives of all orders up to ``k``, and if each of those functions is continuous.

``f`` is **``C^{\infty}``** or **smooth** if `f` is ``C^k`` for all ``k \geq 0``. Alternatively, ``f`` is smooth if for each component function, all partial derivatives exist and are continuous.

A function ``f: U \to V`` for ``U \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n`` and ``V \subseteq \mathbb{R}^m``, both open, is said to be a **diffeomorphism** if it is bijective and smooth with a smooth inverse.
